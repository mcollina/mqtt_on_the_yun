# MQTT on the Yun

A client library for the Arduino Yun that provides support for MQTT.

It is based on [PubSubClient](http://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient),
but it use the awesome `nc` utility to provide TCP support.

This is still very experimental, and I just updated the [mqtt basic](https://github.com/mcollina/mqtt_on_the_yun/tree/master/PubSubClient/examples/mqtt_basic) example.
